## Description
The Burger Place is an application to demonstrate the use of a Model-View-Control(MVC) pipeline. The application itself is simple. Type the name of a burger to order it, once it's ready to eat you can either eat it or send it back to the kitchen. All eaten burgers will appear on the right hand side list.

## Usage
When you load the website, you will be presented with a text input box and a list of burgers ready to eat and burgers already eaten. Type in a burger that you want to order and press the order button. Once it's ready to eat, click the button to eat it and it will move to the eaten column. Delete from either columns by pressing the appropriate button.
